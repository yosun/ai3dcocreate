#### App tagline or elevator pitch (1 sentence)

Expressively Co-Create AI-generated 3D Models in Real Time AR with Gemini in the Real World

#### Describe what your app does and how you used the Gemini API in 1500 characters or less.

What if Gemini can help you create real objects in the real world - your ultimate AI creative assistant co-creating with you in real time 3D augmented reality. 

Presenting the live demo of the world's first 1M context window AI3D LCM creation of our corgi sculpture installation in Union Square. 

We begin by augmenting some rough AI3D primitives that loosely defines our artistic concept.

We then set up our AI3D Easel in a perspective that frames the creation... and let's tell the AI what we want to create in a human-readable prompt. And we can then send this to our creative assistant - Gemini - to iteratively refine the prompt. 

We can also co-create from any perspective. Each new reality view window, inherits the previous prompt, and we can continue to pair-create with Gemini. 

Gemini Pro's multi-modal 2M context window adapts to your workflow, style, and remembers all your screenshots and notes from the creative session. Gemini Flash's lightning fast responses keeps up to real-time refine your flux LCM image generation prompts - to get closer faster to your artistic vision. 

And in the final step we feed our image to an AI3D image to 3D endpoint to get our 3D printable model. 

We hope this inspires you to open your mind to new ways for multi-modal million context-length AI to enable your expressive creativity - everywhere you go. 

Expressively create for the world - faster - with AI3D Co-Create Reality.
